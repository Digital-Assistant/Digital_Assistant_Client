 * - `REST` from `../services`: Provides a REST API client.
 * - `domJSON` from `domjson`: Provides JSON serialization/deserialization functionality.
 * - `TSON` from `typescript-json`: Provides TypeScript-specific JSON serialization/deserialization.
 * - `UDAConsoleLogger` and `UDAErrorLogger` from `../config/error-log`: Provide logging functionality.
 * - `fetchDomain` from `../util/fetchDomain`: Likely provides a way to fetch data from a domain.
 * - `userService` from `../services/userService`: Provides user-related functionality.
 * - `deleteRecording` from `../services/recordService`: Provides a function to delete a recording.

 * - `TSON.stringify`: Mocked to return a constant JSON string.
 * - `UDAConsoleLogger` and `UDAErrorLogger`: Mocked to have `info` and `error` functions that do nothing.

 * - `fetchDomain`: Mocked to be an empty function.

 * These mocks allow the tests in the `recordService_deleterecording.test.ts` file to run without relying on the actual implementation of these dependencies, which can help isolate the behavior being tested.
